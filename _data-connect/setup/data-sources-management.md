You can manage your new data sources by clicking on the name of your source on the **Data Sources** page. You can have up to 50 scheduled jobs on your cluster at time. [Contact ThoughtSpot Support]({{ site.baseurl }}/appliance/contact.html) if you'd like to increase this limit.

After selecting a data source, you have the option to perform a number of editing and maintenance tasks.

## Schedule, edit, and refresh

You can select a table row and click one of the following three buttons to make changes:

-   **Schedule**: Opens a Scheduler menu where you can make changes to the loading schedule.
-   **Edit**: Takes you back to edit the data source details, such as loading another table or truncating an existing one.
-   **Refresh**: Refreshes the data load status.

## Restart the load

Selecting a source and clicking the **Restart** icon will immediately reload the data.

## View log files

You can download the session logs for a data load run. Select a table row, and click **View session logs** at the bottom of the page. View the log file to troubleshoot any failed loads or to simply check the log queries.
