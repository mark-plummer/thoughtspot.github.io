The Help Center can be accessed by clicking on **Help** on the top navigation bar. This opens a simple dialog box with links to How to search, Keywords, Release notes, Documentation, and Downloads. Click one of them to open a new tab containing your selected topic.

The Help Center provides the following resources:

-   **A search bar** - You can use the search bar to search through all of ThoughtSpot's documentation and videos.
-   **Short training videos** - Each of these videos cover a popular topic or feature, especially those that have just been released.
