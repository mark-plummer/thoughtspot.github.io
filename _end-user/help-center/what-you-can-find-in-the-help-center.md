There are multiple locations inside and outside the ThoughtSpot application where you can get more help. This page describes some of the ways to get more help inside or outside of the application interface.

## ThoughtSpot documentation

Each version of ThoughtSpot has its own documentation set. ThoughtSpot releases new documentation sets for every major release version (`x.y`) of ThoughtSpot. Documentation features added with minor versions (`x.y.z`) are added to the corresponding major release. This means, for example, that new documentation for the 6.0.1 minor release version appears in the 6.0 major version documentation.

At the bottom of the **Get Help** section of the **Information Center**, you can see the version of ThoughtSpot you are using.

The Information Center, and many other ThoughtSpot guides, are delivered through Pendo. Pendo is ThoughtSpotâ€™s system for delivery of in-product tips, short videos, and other training elements. Your firewall may automatically block Pendo. To ensure that you can view Pendo guides, ask your ThoughtSpot administrator to add Pendo to a list of allowed domains.
