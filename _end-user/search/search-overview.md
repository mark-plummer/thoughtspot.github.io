Using ThoughtSpot's relational search is intuitive. In the search bar, type what you are interested in exploring, and ThoughtSpot returns a set of results in the form of a table or a chart. We call this set of results in response to a search an
Answer.

ThoughtSpot has two primary search mechanisms:
1. [Search Answers and Liveboards]({{ site.baseurl }}/end-user/search/search-answers.html)
2. [Search Data]({{ site.baseurl }}/end-user/search/about-starting-a-new-search.html)
