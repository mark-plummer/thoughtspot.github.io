Liveboards act like live dashboards. They are collections of your related charts, tables, and headline.

## What are Liveboards

You can pin charts and tables to any Liveboard which you created, and those that have been shared with you with the **Edit** privilege. When you create a Liveboard, you can share it with other people with either the **View** or **Edit** privilege. Liveboards are interactive, allowing you to perform actions like filtering, excluding values, and drill down on the visualizations.


## Create a Liveboard

To create a Liveboard:

1. Click **Liveboards**, on the top navigation bar.

     ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/click-pinboards.png "Liveboards")

2. Click **+ New Liveboard** on the Liveboards list page.

     ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/add_new_pinboard.png "New Liveboard button")

3. In the **New Liveboard** dialog box, give your Liveboard a name and description. Then click **Create**.

## Add an answer to a Liveboard

Instead of saving an answer you can add it to a Liveboard. To add
an answer to a Liveboard:

1. While viewing your answer of interest, click the **Pin** icon at the top right of the answer.

    ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/add_to_pinboard.png "Pin an answer to a Liveboard icon")

2. In the **Add to Liveboard** dialog box, click the **+** icons next to the Liveboards you would like to add your answer to.

    ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/copy_to_pinboard.png "Add filters menu")

   You can also select **Create new Liveboard** at the top of the list to create a new Liveboard, then add your answer to it.


## Download a Liveboard

You can download a Liveboard as a PDF file, without having to download each visualization separately. Downloading a Liveboard works just as it would when downloading an answer: simply click the ellipses icon ![more options menu icon]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/icon-ellipses.png){: .inline} and select **Download as PDF**.

{% include note.html content="If you do not see this option, your company may have removed the Liveboard download option. If you would like to download Liveboards, contact your ThoughtSpot administrator." %}

## Details about a Liveboard

You can see who authored a Liveboard, when it was created, and when it was last modified by choosing **Actions > Liveboard Info**.

## Other Liveboard actions

Other Liveboard actions include actions you normally perform on your search as well as actions that you can only perform on a Liveboard. Most of these actions are found under the **Actions** button.

Other actions are available on a Liveboard display itself. Some actions always appear, while others appear only when you hover over specific locations of the Liveboard. This diagram displays active action areas on a Liveboard.

If you make a change to a Liveboard, the system recognizes this and displays an alert message with a **Save changes** button at the top of the page. Click this button to make your changes permanent.
