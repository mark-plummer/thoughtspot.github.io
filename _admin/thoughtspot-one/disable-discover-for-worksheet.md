When users search for existing answers and Liveboards, the default experience is to search across all worksheets that they have access to. As an analyst, you may not want users to search for existing answer and Liveboards built on certain worksheets that are works in progress or deprecated. You can do this without unsharing those worksheets.

To disable searching for answer and Liveboards built on a specific worksheet, follow these steps.

1. Navigate to the worksheet.

2. Select the **More** menu ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/icon-more-10px.png){: .inline} at the top right of the screen.

3. Select **Disable Answer Search**.

    ![Disable Answer Search]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/disable-answer-search.png "Disable Answer Search")

4. A confirmation window appears. Select **Yes, disable it**.

    {% include note.html content="It can take about 6 hours to disable Answer Search for a specific worksheet. You may notice that users still see results from that worksheet for about 6 hours after you select <strong>Yes, disable it.</strong>" %}

Note that you can re-enable Answer Search on that worksheet in the same way, by selecting the **More** menu ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/icon-more-10px.png){: .inline} and selecting **Enable Answer Search**. It can also take about 6 hours to re-enable. When your worksheet is fully published and no longer a work in progress, don't forget to re-enable searching for existing objects on it!
