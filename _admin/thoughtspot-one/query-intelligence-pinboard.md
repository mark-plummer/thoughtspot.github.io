## Best practices
You can use the Stats and Trends Pinboard to understand your company's use of ThoughtSpot in many ways. Here are a few of the most useful ways to interact with this Pinboard.

1. **Monitor Adoption**:<br>
    Keep track of the [number of searches](#number-of-searches) on existing Answers and Pinboards in the last 7 days, and on the [number of searches on Answers on a weekly basis](#weekly-searches).

2. **View what's trending in your organization**:<br>
    Users' search queries reflect what information is important to them. To understand what data users currently find valuable, view [Top Search Queries on existing answers](#top-search-existing), which has data from the last 30 days.

    You can also see which queries had no satisfactory answer for the user, based on the click position and the count of queries with either no results. Consider building Answers and Pinboards that satisfy these queries, or renaming existing objects to match what search terms users use.

3. **Determine what content you should create**:<br>
    Use this Pinboard to determine what Answers and Pinboards you should create for your users. View [Top Search Queries with zero results](#top-search-existing-no-result) and [Top Search Queries where the user did not click on any result](#top-search-not-useful). If a query has zero results, you have no content for this query. Consider building Answers and Pinboards that satisfy it. If a user does not click on any results, you may have content for this query, but it may not be discoverable. Consider renaming existing objects to match what search terms users use.

4. **Monitor how users are finding content you created**:<br>
    As a content creator, you may want to see which search queries result in users clicking on Answers and Pinboards you created. In [Top Search Queries on existing answers](#top-search-existing), click **Explore**. Filter by **Result title**, specifying your content's title(s). This filter provides a list of the top search queries that resulted in users clicking on your content, in the last 30 days. Use this information to determine how to slightly alter your descriptions or titles to make your content more discoverable.

5. **Analyze which search results are useful for a specific query**:<br>
    The [Top results users are clicking on](#top-results) visualization lists the top 10 search results users clicked on in the last 30 days. You may want to find this information for a specific query. In [Top results users are clicking on](#top-results), click **Explore**. Filter by **query text**, specifying the query text you want to analyze.
