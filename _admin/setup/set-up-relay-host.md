## Configure using tscli

Set up SMTP rules to send critical email notifications to ThoughtSpot Support.

### Set up the relay Host

To set up a relay host:

1. Log in to the Linux shell using SSH.
2. Issue the setup command, providing the IP address of the relay host:

    ```
    $ tscli smtp set-relayhost <IP_address>
    ```

    The system uses port 25 to connect to the relay host. [Contact ThoughtSpot Support]({{ site.baseurl }}/admin/misc/contact.html) if port 25 is blocked in your environment.

3. Verify your settings:

    ```
    $ tscli smtp show-relayhost
    ```

4. Verify that email is working.

### Configure an email to receive alerts

ThoughtSpot sends alerts to the email address specified during installation. If no email address was entered, no alerts are sent. You should add an email to receive alerts by issuing:

```
$ tscli monitoring set-config --email <your_email>
```

To send to multiple emails, provide a comma-separated list with no spaces.

### Verify the relay with an email

Check if the email settings are working properly by using this procedure.

 1. Log in to the Linux shell using SSH.
 2. Try sending an email to yourself by issuing:

    ```
    $ echo | mail -s Hello <your_email>
    ```

 3. If you receive the email at the address(es) you supplied, email is working correctly.
