To create a group and add privileges for the group, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the Admin Console by clicking on the **Admin** tab from the top navigation bar.

     ![Enter details for the new group]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/add-group.png "Enter details for the new group")

    <table>
    <colgroup>
    <col width="20%" />
    <col width="80%" />
    </colgroup>
     <tr>
       <th>Field</th>
       <th>Description</th>
     </tr>
     <tr id="group-name">
       <th>Group name</th>
       <td>Enter a unique name for the group.</td>
     </tr>
     <tr id="display-name">
       <th>Display name</th>
       <td>Name of the group as it appears in ThoughtSpot.</td>
     </tr>
     <tr id="sharing-visibioity">
       <th>Sharing visibility</th>
       <td>Indicate whether objects can be shared with this group. When set to <b>SHAREABLE</b>,
       this group is an option in the <b>Share</b> dialog.</td>
     </tr>
     <tr id="description">
       <th>Description</th>
       <td>Optionally, enter a description.</td>
     </tr>
     <tr id="privileges">
       <th>Privileges</th>
       <td>Check the <a href="{{"/admin/users-groups/about-users-groups.html#list-of-privileges" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">privileges</a> you want to grant to the group. If you add the privilege <b>Has administration privileges</b> to a group, all users in that group can see all the data in ThoughtSpot. Administrators can always see all data sources, and <a href="{{"/admin/data-security/about-row-security.html#" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">Row level security</a> does not
       apply to them.
       </td>
     </tr>
    </table>
