You can create users directly in ThoughtSpot, or import users and user groups through SAML or similar protocols.

For users who have access through SAML, the SAML installation manages all user information.

## Create a user in ThoughtSpot

This procedure demonstrates how to create a user manually. When you create a user, you can specify the _[username](#username)_, _[display name](#display-name)_, _[sharing visibility](#sharing-visibility)_, the _[password](#password)_, _[email](#email)_, whether they get a _[welcome email](#welcome-email)_ and its _[text](#welcome-text)_, and assign _[group](#groups)_ memberships. The user inherits privileges and permissions directly from the group assignments.

Note that all users automatically belong to the group **All**.

To create a new user and assign that user to groups, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the Admin Console by clicking on the **Admin** tab from the top navigation bar.

2. Select **Users** from the side navigation bar that appears.

    ![Admin Console - Users]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/admin-portal-users.png "Admin Console - Users")

5. Click the **+ Add User** button on the upper left-hand side of the list of users.

5. In the **Add a new user** interface, enter the details for the new user:
