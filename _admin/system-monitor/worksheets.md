Most of the monitoring information in ThoughtSpot's system Pinboards comes from system
Worksheets and Views that administrators can view, but not modify. The underlying tables
are protected system tables that you cannot access directly. However,
administrators can create new, custom monitoring reports from the Worksheets and Views.

## List the system Worksheets and Views

To list the system Worksheets and Views:

1. Go to the **Data** tab.
2. Choose **All** and **All types**.
3. Enter `System User` in the search field.
