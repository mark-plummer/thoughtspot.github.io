ThoughtSpot Search results generate tables and charts. When you save them for future use, we call these saved searches answers.

## Creating an Answer

![Visualize Search]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/visualize-search.gif "Search, and save it as an Answer")

To create a search, and save it as an answer, follow these steps:

1. Click **Search**.

2. In the upper right corner, click the datasource icon.

3. Under **Data**, select **Choose sources**.

   Alternatively, click one of the sources that are already listed.

4. In the **Choose sources** interface, select one or more sources, and click **Close**.  

   We strongly recommend that you use worksheets rather than tables, because of the many benefits worksheets provide.

6. After you select the **Data Source**, start typing your question in the search bar.

6. As you type each word of your search, ThoughtSpot helps you identify possible options, both from the data source and from its library of supporting terms and keywords.

7.  After you finish entering your search terms, hit the **Return** or **Enter** on your keyboard, click outside the search bar, or click the search icon at the right of the search bar.

    You just created the first search result on your own data.

8. Click the More icon ![more options menu icon]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/icon-ellipses.png){: .inline}, and select **Save**.

9. In the **Save Answer** modal,

   - Accept the suggested name, or enter a new name for your visualization.
   - \[Optional\] Add a Description
   - Click **Save**.

***Congratulations!*** You have an answer that you can use in your Liveboards. To find this and other answers, click **Answer** on the top navigation bar.
