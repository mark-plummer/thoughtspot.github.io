Passthrough functions allow you to send SQL expressions directly to Snowflake without being interpreted by ThoughtSpot. If you have custom database functions that ThoughtSpot doesnâ€™t support, you can use these new passthrough functions in the ThoughtSpot Formula Assistant to call your custom functions.

A passthrough function serves as a wrapper around the specific Snowflake SQL function. To use a specific Snowflake SQL function, match the data type that the function returns with the Connections passthrough function that returns that data type.

For details on all supported passthrough functions, see [Connections passthrough functions]({{ site.baseurl }}/reference/formula-reference.html#passthrough-functions).

For details on Snowflake SQL functions, see Snowflake's [SQL Function Reference](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference-functions.html){:target="_blank"}.
