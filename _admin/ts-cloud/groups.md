Before people can log in and use ThoughtSpot, you need to create a username, a
password, and a membership in one or more groups for them. Use the Admin Console to easily create and manage your user groups.

Refer to [Understand groups and privileges]({{ site.baseurl }}/admin/users-groups/about-users-groups.html) to learn about the privileges you can assign to a user or group.

To manage groups, navigate to the Admin Console by clicking on the **Admin** tab from the top navigation bar. Select **Groups** from the side navigation bar that appears.

You can use the Admin Console to accomplish the following tasks:
* **Create a group** by clicking on the **+ add group** button
* **Manage an existing group** by clicking on the group you would like to edit: change the group's default Liveboard, add an existing group to the group, add a user to the group, modify the group's privileges, or resend or test the welcome email
* **Delete a group** by hovering over a group name, clicking the checkbox that appears, and selecting the **Delete** button
