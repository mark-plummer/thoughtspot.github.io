## Overview

The new Answer experience contains multiple new features and feature enhancements. It is part of ThoughtSpot's move to a new stack. It is in <span class="badge badge-update">Beta</span> and ***off*** by default for individual ThoughtSpot Cloud users. However, the option to turn it on or off [individually](#toggle-on-off) is on by default. To remove or enable this option, [contact ThoughtSpot Support]({{ site.baseurl }}/admin/misc/contact.html). If the new Answer experience is available in your environment, turn it on or off individually from your profile, in the **Experience manager** at the bottom of your profile. The new Answer experience contains the following features:

## Turn the new Answer experience on or off for the whole cluster
You can manage the availability of the new Answer experience by [contacting ThoughtSpot Support]({{ site.baseurl }}/admin/misc/contact.html). ThoughtSpot Support can turn the new Answer experience on or off globally, and specify the default answer experience for all users. For example, you can turn the new Answer experience on globally, but still have the classic experience as the default, allowing users to opt into the new experience.
