Your organization selected the most relevant data for your exploration. In ThoughtSpot's [business user onboarding]({{ site.baseurl }}/admin/ts-cloud/business-user-onboarding.html), you can select the recommended data source.

This data set determines what you can search, which Liveboards you can create or interact with, and what answers and insights youâ€™ll find. For example, a user in the Finance department might see a **payroll** data set, while a user in Sales might see a **pipeline** data set.

Refer to [Start a new search]({{ site.baseurl }}/end-user/search/start-a-new-search.html) to learn more about choosing a data source and searching your data in ThoughtSpot, or watch this video about how to complete your first search:
