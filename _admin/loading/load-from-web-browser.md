## Formatting the CSV

Your ETL (extract, transform, load) process will typically generate CSV files. You can also create a CSV file from a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet by opening the spreadsheet in Excel, choosing **Save As** and selecting CSV.

{% include content/csv-format.md %}

If you are loading a fact table that joins to dimension tables, you must load the fact table first, and then the dimension tables. The joining key must be a single column of unique values in the dimension table. `NULL` values in the fact table cannot be joined.

## Create a CSV file

{% include content/csv-create.md %}

For general information about CSV files and the rules for creating them, see the Comma-separated_values on Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values).
