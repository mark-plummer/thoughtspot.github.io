Before you install the mobile app, ask your ThoughtSpot administrator where you should get it, and which method of VPN (if any) you should use to access your ThoughtSpot cluster.

## Set up VPN

Ask your ThoughtSpot administrator, which of the following methods you should use to securely sign in to  the app and access your ThoughtSpot cluster:

### Per-app VPN [Recommended]

If you download the app from your company's internal app store (mobile device management platform), you can sign in using the powerful and secure Per-APP VPN feature provided by your platform. Ask your administrator which platform your company uses, and then use one of the following resources to configure the VPN options:

- [Workspace ONE (AirWatch)](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Workspace-ONE-UEM/1811/VMware-Workspace-ONE-UEM-iOS-Device-Management/GUID-AWT-IOS-PROFILEVPN.html){:target="_blank"}
- [MobileIron](http://mi.extendedhelp.mobileiron.com/53/all/en/desktop/Per-App_VPN_Configuration.htm){:target="_blank"}
- [XenMobile (Citrix)](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-endpoint-management/policies/vpn-policy.html){:target="_blank"}
- [Intune](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/vpn-setting-configure-per-app){:target="_blank"}

### Standard VPN

If you download the app from the App Store for iOS or Google Play for Android, you can use standard VPN to sign in.

- Open the VPN app on your iOS/Android device and authenticate.

## Install the app

Contact your ThoughtSpot administrator, to determine where to get the app.

### App Store or Google Play

If your company allows you to download it from the App Store for iOS or Google Play, download it from here:

### Your company's internal app store (if applicable)
