SpotIQ comparative analysis compares data points of simple or complex measures using these aggregates:  
  * _Sum_
  * _Count_
  * _Sum over sum_, which generate a Pinboard that has 'what-if' percentage insights
  * _Average_, which generate a Pinboard that has 'what-if' percentage insights
  * Other functions which use a 'versus' analysis to show the absolute change grouped by different drill attributes

## Advanced Comparative Analysis in SpotIQ ##

ThoughtSpot ships with a number of comparative algorithms. Using the **Advanced** option of SpotIQ, you can adjust the parameters of the analysis, or choose a different comparative algorithm for your data.  

After selecting the relevant analysis columns, click the **Advanced** tab.  

Under **Select Algorithms**, select the name of the algorithm. You may have several options available, or only a single one. In this example, the only valid option is **Change Analysis**.  

Under **Customize algorithm for comparative analysis**, adjust the options. In this example, the algorithm parameters are __Max Diff Elements__, __Max Fraction__, __Min Abs Change Ratio__, and __Min Change Ratio__.
