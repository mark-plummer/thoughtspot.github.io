Everywhere in ThoughtSpot where you can run **SpotIQ analyze**, you
can configure a customized SpotIQ analysis. The customized analysis can be
a one-time customization or can apply to all future analysis of that particular
data source.

## Finding customization controls

Every menu or location where you can run **SpotIQ analyze**, you
can customize your analysis. You access it using the lightbulb button ![more options menu icon]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/icon-lightbulb.png){: .inline} or the ellipses menu ![SpotIQ analyze icon]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/icon-ellipses.png){: .inline}.

Regardless of where you run **SpotIQ analyze** in ThoughtSpot, the **SpotIQ** window has the same layout. The columns displayed, though, are specific to
the data from which you run **SpotIQ analyze**.

This window has two tabs:
* **Columns**, where you can explicitly indicate which columns to include in a SpotIQ analysis. (You can select all, some, or none.)
* **Advanced**, where you can run custom analyses and incorporate R scripts into SpotIQ <span class="label label-beta">Deprecated 7.1.1</span>.


The **Advanced** tab has many options. The panel scrolls, so more algorithms are available than appear in the following image

The **SpotIQ** insights page has an option to open this window to
customize a single analysis.

The **Tell us more** window provides information on how to exclude a value from all future analysis.

You can set SpotIQ customization parameters in your
[SpotIQ preferences]({{ site.baseurl }}/_spotiq/spotiq-preferences.html), along with options for email notifications when analyses run.

## Eliminate null values

Null values should be eliminated from your analysis.  

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>From next analysis</th>
    <th>From future analyses</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
    <!-- next -->
    <p>In the Search bar, add a filter <code><i>column</i>!= Null</code> to the search bar. Or choose <b>Exclude null values from current analysis</b>, using the <b>Advanced</b> panel.</p>
    </td>
    <td>
    <!-- future -->
    Set <b>Exclude null values from my analysis</b> on your user <b>Profile</b> to exclude them from any future  SpotIQ analyses you do.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Exclude uninteresting column(s) in insight

You should always exclude columns you are not interested from your analysis.  

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>From next analysis</th>
    <th>From future analyses</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
    <!-- next -->
    <p>Use the <b>EXCLUDE</b> option of <b>SPOTIQ PREFERENCE</b> under the <b>DATA</b> tab to exclude any column permanently from all future analysis.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Include an interesting column

You can always include columns that interest you in your analysis.  

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>From next analysis</th>
    <th>From future analyses</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
    <!-- next -->
    <p>Choose <b>Customize analysis</b> and select columns that you want to include.</p>
    </td>
    <td>
    <!-- future -->
    Ensure <b>Index Priority</b> is between 8-10 on the column under the <b>DATA</b> tab.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Remove known date outliers

Your data may contain known outliers. For example, you are in the middle of a quarter and only want to analyze the previous quarter. Anything from the present quarter could contain an outlier.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>From next analysis</th>
    <th>From future analyses</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
    <!-- next -->
    <p>In the Search bar, add a filter <code><i>date</i>< last time period</code> to the search bar.</p>  </td>
    <td>
    <!-- future -->
    Not applicable.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>


## Too few insights

Your SpotIQ analysis may not provide you as many insights as you think it should.

<table style="border:1px;">
  <tr>
    <th>From next analysis</th>
    <th>From future analyses</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
    <!-- next -->
    <p>Choose <b>Customize analysis</b>, select the <b>Advanced</b> tab, and decrease the <b>Multiplier for Outlier Detection</b> to a value closer to zero.
</p>
</td>
    <td>
    <!-- future -->
    Not applicable.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Explaining Anomaly Insights

When SpotIQ finds insights with anomaly points, you have the option to run the Explain Insight command to have SpotIQ do further analysis on the anomaly points.

To explain an insight, do the following:

1. Click the ellipses icon ![more options menu icon]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/icon-ellipses.png){: .inline} for the insight you want to explain and select **Explain insight**.

2. In the SpotIQ window, click **Analyze**.

   Analysis begins.

3. Click **SpotIQ** in the top navigation bar.

4. Click the **Analyses** tab.

5. Find the name of the insight that you analyzed and click **View Results**.

   The results of your insight analysis explaining your anomaly points appear.
