<p>Total rows in a result of a join can have an impact on performance. In general, we recommend that you have fewer than 10 billion rows in a many-to-many join.</p>

<p>Contact ThoughtSpot support for guidance on boundaries for the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Maximum number of rows that can be downloaded</li>
  <li>Size in CSV format</li>
  <li>Total number of rows across all tables</li>
  <li>Many-to-Many (Generic join cardinality)</li>
  <li>Load frequency</li>
</ul>
