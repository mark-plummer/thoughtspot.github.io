You can add a formula directly within a search. Some common reasons for using a formula in a search are to perform mathematical functions, check for and replace null values, or add conditional logic.

## How to add a formula

To create a formula in a search:

1. Start a new search, or choose an existing answer from a pinboard to edit.

3. In the upper-right side of the table, click the **more options** icon  ![more options menu icon]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/icon-ellipses.png){: .inline} and select **Add formula**.

4. Name and enter your formula in the Formula Builder.

    {% include note.html content="Formula elements are color coded by type and can include the formula operators and functions (blue), the names of columns (purple), and/or constants (black)." %}

5.  You can see a list of formula operators with examples by clicking **Formula Assistant.** Expand a category, such as **Operators**, and click on a formula operator for a definition and example.

6.  If you want to change what your formula returns, use the **Advanced settings**. Depending on your formula, you may be able to change the following aspects:

    -   **Data type**: Determines the type of data that the formula generates. For example, use `date` for an `add_days` formula.
    -   **Measure or attribute**: Determines if the output of the formula is a measure or an attribute. For example, choose `attribute` for a formula that generates age groups, and choose `measure` for a formula that generates profit.
    -   **Aggregation**: Determines the default aggregation of the formula output. For example, choose `min` to see minimum profit.

7. Click **Save**. Name your formula, if you did not already name it.
