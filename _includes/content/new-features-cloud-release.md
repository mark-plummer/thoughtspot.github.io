<dlentry id="spotapps">
<dt>ServiceNow SpotApp <span class="label label-beta">Beta</span></dt>
<dd><p>SpotApps are ThoughtSpot's new out-of-the-box solution templates built for specific use cases and data sources. They are built on Blocks, which are pre-built pieces of code that are easy to download and implement directly from the product. This release introduces the ServiceNow SpotApp and Analytics Blocks. Analytics Blocks include pre-built Worksheet, Answer, and Liveboard Blocks.</p>
<p>The ServiceNow SpotApp mimics the ServiceNow data model. After you connect to your ServiceNow data in your cloud data warehouse, ThoughtSpot maps that data to SpotApp columns, and creates pre-built but still customizable worksheets, answers, and Liveboards, based on your ServiceNow data.</p>
<p>Refer to <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/admin/ts-cloud/app-templates.html">SpotApps</a>.</p>
<p>This feature is in beta and off by default. It is part of the <a href="#data-tab">Data tab redesign</a> beta. To enable SpotApps and the Data tab redesign, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/admin/misc/contact.html">contact ThoughtSpot Support</a>.</p></dd>
</dlentry>

<dlentry>
<dt>SQL-based views <span class="label label-beta">Beta</span></dt>
<dd><p>This release introduces beta support for SQL-based views. Users can create views based on SQL queries, and use those views as data sources. This type of view has the same functionality as a view based on searching your data.</p>
<p>This feature is in beta and off by default. To enable it, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/admin/misc/contact.html">contact ThoughtSpot Support</a>.</p></dd>
</dlentry>

<dlentry id="data-tab">
<dt>Data tab redesign <span class="label label-beta">Beta</span></dt>
<dd><p>This release redesigns the <strong>Data</strong> section of the product. To access this part of the product, select <strong>Data</strong> from the top navigation bar. The redesign introduces several new features, such as SQL-based views and SpotApps, and makes the UI more intuitive.</p>

<dlentry id="date-interval-functions">
<dt>Date interval functions</dt>
<dd><p>In this release, we introduced new functions for computing time intervals between two dates. In addition to the existing <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/reference/formula-reference.html#diff_days">diff_days</a> and <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/reference/formula-reference.html#diff_time">diff_time</a> functions, you can now use <code>diff_years</code>, <code>diff_quarters</code>, <code>diff_months</code>, <code>diff_weeks</code>, <code>diff_hours</code>, and <code>diff_minutes</code> to calculate time intervals at these additional granularities.</p>
<p>If your organization uses a <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/admin/ts-cloud/ts-cloud-embrace-cust-cal.html">custom calendar</a>, which can specify a new starting date of a year, starting dates of quarters, a starting day of the month, and a starting day of the week, use the optional custom calendar argument with these functions to calculate the difference between the two dates.</p>

<dlentry id="auto-answer">
<dt>Automated answer creation in Setup</dt>
<dd><p>We simplified the steps to create Search visualizations during Setup. Now, you can select measures, attributes and date columns and immediately view suggested answers and visualizations.

<dlentry id="liveboard-announcement">
<dt></dt>
<dd><p>Starting in December 2021, ThoughtSpot refers to Liveboards instead of pinboards. With Liveboards, you can have an interactive experience and get granular insights through live queries on cloud data, tailored for you. You can use Livebaords to iterate, explore, and drill into more insights, and tell a continuously evolving data story.<br/>
ThoughtSpot plans to support for several releases, and then retire, internal processes and external methods that use the older naming convention.</p></dd>
</dlentry>

<dlentry id="session-validity">
<dt>User session timeout and validity</dt>
<dd>ThoughtSpot increased the duration of <strong>idle session timeouts</strong> and the <strong>maximum session validity</strong>, when you click <strong>Remember me</strong> on the login screen. There is no change to the duration when you do not click <strong>Remember me</strong>.
<ul>
<li>Idle session timeout: If a user is not active for 14 days, ThoughtSpot logs the user out, and the user must enter their login credentials again.</li>
<li>Maximum session validity: ThoughtSpot forces the user's session to expire after 14 days, even if they are active throughout that period.</li> </ul>
<p>This change <strong><em>only</em></strong> affects new clusters created on the November Cloud release and later. Clusters created on the October Cloud release and earlier have the old experience, even after they update to the November Cloud release. In the old experience, the <strong>idle session timeout</strong> is 60 minutes with <strong>Remember me</strong>, and 30 minutes without it. The old <strong>maximum session validity</strong> is 7 days with <strong>Remember me</strong>, and not available without it.</p>
<p>To increase idle session timeouts or maximum session validity for clusters created on the October Cloud release and earlier, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/admin/misc/contact.html">contact ThoughtSpot Support</a>.</p></dd></dlentry>

<dlentry id="search-suggestions">
<dt>Search suggestions</dt>
<dd><p>Search suggestions are now GA. When you <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/end-user/search/search-answers.html">search across existing answers and Liveboards</a>, ThoughtSpot now offers search suggestions in the search bar, based on your past searches and popular searches in your environment, in addition to object suggestions. For example, if you type <code>Sal</code> in the search bar, it might now result in search suggestions like <strong>Sales</strong> and <strong>Sales this year</strong>, in addition to object suggestions like an existing Liveboard called <strong>Sales in the east last year</strong>.</p>
<p>ThoughtSpot provides search suggestions before you begin typing, but not object suggestions.</p>
</dd>
</dlentry>

<dlentry id="search-data-toggle">
<dt>Search data</dt>
<dd><p>To make it easier for users to find new insights, we moved the <strong>Search data functionality</strong> from the search bar toggle on the home page to the <strong>Search data</strong> button in the main navigation bar.</p>

You can ask ThoughtSpot Support to disable either one of these checks. If you use both, and either check fails, ThoughtSpot does not authenticate the user. Some IDPs do not support use of <code>SessionNotOnOrAfter</code>.
